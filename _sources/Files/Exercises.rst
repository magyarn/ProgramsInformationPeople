   This summer I will be travelling.
   I will go to...
   Italy: Rome
   Greece: Athens
   England: London, Manchester
   France: Paris, Nice, Lyon
   Spain: Madrid, Barcelona, Granada
   Austria: Vienna
   I will probably not even want to come back! 
   However, I wonder how I will get by with all the different languages.
   I only know English!

   Writing essays for school can be difficult but
   many students find that by researching their topic that they
   have more to say and are better informed. Here are the university
   we require many undergraduate students to take a first year writing requirement
   so that they can
   have a solid foundation for their writing skills. This comes
   in handy for many students.
   Different schools have different requirements, but everyone uses
   writing at some point in their academic career, be it essays, research papers,
   technical write ups, or scripts.

1. The textfile, ``files_extra.txt``, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable ``num``.

.. activecode:: ee_files_01
   :topics: Files/Iteratingoverlinesinafile

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(num, 316, "Testing that num value is assigned to correct value.")

   myTests().main()

1.1 Using the file ``school_prompt.txt``, find the number of characters and assign that value to the variable ``num_char``.

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(num_char, 537, "Testing that num_char has the correct value.")

   myTests().main()

1.2 We have provided a file called ``emotion_words.txt`` that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable ``num_words``.
