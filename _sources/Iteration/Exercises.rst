   1. Write code to create a list of integers from 0 through 52 and assign that list to the variable ``numbers``. You should use a special Python function -- do not type out the whole list yourself. HINT: You can do this in one line of code!

   2. For each character in the string already saved in the variable ``str1``, append each character to a list called ``chars``.

   str1 = "I love python"
   # HINT: what's the accumulator? That should go here.

   3. Assign an empty string to the variable ``output``. Using the ``range`` function, write code to make it so that the variable ``output`` has 35 ``a`` s inside it (like ``"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"``). Hint: use the accumulation pattern!

   5. **Challenge** Now do the same as in problem 4, but do not create a new list. Overwrite the list ``numbs`` so that each of the original numbers are increased by 5.

   6.1 **Challenge** Do the same as above, but do not create a new list. Instead, overwrite the old list so that ``verbs`` has the same words with ``ing`` at the end of each one.

   7. For each string in ``wrds``, add 'ed' to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called ``past_wrds``.
