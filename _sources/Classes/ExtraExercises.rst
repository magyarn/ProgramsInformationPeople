4. This problem will modify your previously defined class, ``BankAccount``. Add two more instance variables, ``deposits`` and ``withdrawals``. Add two more methods, ``add_deposit`` and ``less_withdrawals``. The add_deposit method should add the deposit amount to amt and the less_withdrawals method should subtract the withdrawal amount from amt. Create two instances of the class, the first assigned to ``bob`` and the second to ``sally``. The first uses "Bob" as the name, 100 as the start_amt, and 50 as the deposit amount. The second uses "Sally" as the name, 200 as the start amount, 0 as the deposit, and 125 as the withdrawal amount. For ``bob``, call add_deposit enough times so that the start_amt is 200 dollars and save to the variable ``bob_amt``. For ``sally``, call less_withdrawal enough times so that the start_amt is 75 dollars and save to the variable ``sally_amt``.

4.1 Create a class called Sports that contains 3 instance variables, name, number_of_players, and recruit_max. Add the instance method that allows you to customize the message returned when you print the instance so that it says "The name of this sport is [name goes here] and [number_of_players goes here] people create one team!" There should also be another class method called recruiting, which will add the recruit_max to the current value for number_of_players.Create two instances of the class, one assigned to the variable football_info and one called quidditch_info. The first uses football as the name and has 11 players and a max number of 3 recruits, the second uses quidditch as the name and has 7 players and a max number of 2 recruits. Call recruiting enough times so that football_info has 17 players and that quidditch_info has 9 players.

5. **Challenge** The class, ``Olympics``, is given and has two instance variables, country and medal, referencing a country and its corresponding medal count in the Rio Olympics. The list, ``L``, gives some countries and their medal counts. Create a list of instances from the given list and assign it to the variable ``instances``. Then, sort the instances based on medal count and then alphabetically by country name. The sorted medal count list should be assigned to the variable ``sort_medal`` and be a list of tuples displaying both the country name and medal count from highest medal count to lowest. The list sorted alphabetically should only display the country name and be assigned to the variable ``sort_alpha``.

5.1 **Challenge:** Provided is a class called called ``Music`` that has 3 instance variables, title, genre, and price. Provided is a list of tuples. Assign them to a new list and use the tuples to as parameters for instances of Music. Then, assign to the variable ``music_genre`` a sorted list of the instances' titles by genre a-z. Assign to the variable ``music_price`` a sorted list of the instances' titles by price, low to high. Hint: sorted won't return the str method, so you will need to specify the title some way.

5.2 **Challenge:** Below, we have provided a list of tuples. Use these to create a list of instances of the House class. Each instance should have three instance variables: color, rooms, and price. When an instance is printed, the user should see: "This is a [color] house with [rooms] rooms that costs [price] dollars." Save the list of instances as the variable ``houses``. Then, sort the list based on price, highest to lowest, and save this list as ``houses_by_price``. Finally, sort the list based on number of rooms, highest to lowest, and save this last as ``houses_by_rooms``.
